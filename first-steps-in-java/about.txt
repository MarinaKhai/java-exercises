FindSubstrings.java,

are a part of coursera program of Duke University. Course's name is Java Programming: Solving Problems with Software;
these are problem solving exercises made by myself without any copy-paste.
StorageResource, FileResource and similar classes are from edu.duke library, created by teachers for training purposes. They simulate standard java classes, but are a little simlified.
